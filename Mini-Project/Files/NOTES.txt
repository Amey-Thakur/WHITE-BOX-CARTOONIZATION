As we can see, GANs have a very impressive results and realistic content. It can also be modelled for other applications like image restoration

But it is very difficult to train it. As the outputs are realistic, not real due to the loss function.

As you may know loss function helps to evaluate the algorithm and models the dataset.

If the predictions are totally off, then the loss function will output a higher number. If they're pretty good, it'll output a lower number.


In Surface Representation we used Edge Preserving Filtering. It is basically an image processing technique.

It helps to reduce noise and smoothens image while retaining the texture and sharp edges.


In Structure representation 

We at first use felzenszwalb algorithm to segment images into separate regions. 

As superpixel algorithms only consider the similarity of pixels and take average colour value 

We further introduce selective search to merge segmented regions

Finally, we used adaptive colouring Algorithm as it enhances the contrast and reduces hazing effect


In texture representation, we used random colour shift algorithm as it removes unnecessary colour information and generates random intensity map with luminance
